# Project Vanilla: Back to Basics
This repository showcases a collection of **frontend development projects** built solely using **plain JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **semantic HTML**. It serves as a testament to my commitment to mastering the core web development technologies—without relying on frameworks, preprocessors, or external libraries.

Each project is sourced from platforms like [**Frontend Mentor**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) and [**Dev Challenges**](https://devchallenges.io/dashboard), providing real-world UI/UX challenges designed to sharpen my skills in crafting fully responsive, accessible, and maintainable web applications.
