# Basics: 

This repository is my playground for experimenting with the core building blocks of the web - HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

Each project here is a small-scale challenge crafted to refine my understanding of frontend fundamentals, UI/UX design, and clean, maintainable code without relying on frameworks, preprocessors, or external libraries.

The challenges are sourced from platforms like [**Frontend Mentor**](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) and [**Dev Challenges**](https://devchallenges.io/dashboard), offering real-world scenarios that test everything from responsive layouts to accessibility and user interactivity.
