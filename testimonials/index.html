            <p class="review-text text1">“I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
              transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
              for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
              the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            “Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
             professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
             student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
             did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
             project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
             could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
             experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
             100% recommend!”
